This is an illustration of a bug in Sumatra where files
with a '+' in the filename cannot be displayed or downloaded
in the web interface.

To reproduce:

   make init-sumatra
   make run
   smtweb

This will create a record for a Sumatra run and open a web
browser with the Sumatra web interface. Next:

  - Click on the project name to reach the Sumatra dashboard.

  - Click on the link for the Sumatra record that was just created.

  - Scroll down to the "Output files" section.

  - Click on the link for the file "png_file_with_ _symbol_in_filename.png"

This should display the plot contents, but instead there is an empty space.
When pressing the "Download image" button, an error occurs ("Page not found (404)").

In the error message it becomes apparent that the '+' sign is converted
to a space (encoded by '%20') in the URL.
